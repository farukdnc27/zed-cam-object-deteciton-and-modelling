# ZED Camera Object Detection and Modeling

This project provides a comprehensive suite of tools for working with the ZED Stereo Camera. It includes modules for object detection, 3D modeling, depth sensing, spatial mapping, and specific industrial applications like stone measurement.

## 🎯 Core Purpose

The fundamental goal of this project is to leverage the **ZED 2i stereo camera** alongside various advanced algorithms—including **YOLOv8** for object detection, **Point Cloud** processing for 3D reconstruction, and **Voxel Grid** analysis for volumetric estimation—to accurately distinguish objects from their environment. We aim to precisely estimate their dimensions and iteratively improve the accuracy of these measurements.
